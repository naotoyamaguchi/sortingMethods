## Bubble Sort

### ELI5

Go down a list (array) of numbers in pairs incrementing by one. If the first number is greater than the second number, switch the two around and go on (else keep go on). Once you reach the end of the list, repeat. If you iterate through the array and there are no switch/swaps, you are complete.
